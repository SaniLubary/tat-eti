# ▪▪▪From React's main page Tictactoe guide to an Online Tateti▫▫▫
Simple online Tateti with __*Ngrok*__,  __*Typescript*__ and __*React*__. 
Im following the React's main page TicTacToe tutorial and a sh** ton of typescript research to adapt the React's main page guide with TypeScript, it's being a lot harder than expected so this is really slow, but its satisfying. Never used TypeScript before so I should've started separately with it, but its too late (。・ω・。).

#### To start project *run*:
> `yarn install`  
> `yarn start`
