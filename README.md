# ▪▪▪From React's main page Tictactoe guide to an Online Tateti▫▫▫
Simple online Tateti with __*Typescript*__, __*React*__, __*Ngrok*__ and I guess __*Socket.IO*__ and __*Express.js*__. 
Im following the React's main page TicTacToe tutorial and a sh** ton of TypeScript research to adapt the guide to it.  

It's being a lot harder than expected so this is really slow, but its satisfying. Never used TypeScript before so I should've started separately with it, but its too late (。・ω・。).

Yes, I pretend to use this readme as a blog for the proyect until its finished.
### Getting Started
_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

#### To start project *run*:
> `yarn install`  
> `yarn start`

#### Lastly
My only way to give life to Readmes is with emojis, so here -> ❤
